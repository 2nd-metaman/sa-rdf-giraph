sa-rdf-giraph README: 

This project contains code which uses Apache Giraph to load an RDF graph from an adjacency CSV file. 

The code works if you run the SimpleRDFVertexTest.java, however it does not run when submitting the job to Hadoop. 

These are the commands which I used for submitting the job to hadoop: 

In the directory of this project: mvn clean assembly:assembly

In HADOOP_HOME: bin/hadoop jar ../sa-rdf-giraph-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-job.jar ie.deri.uimr.rdfvertex.LoadRDFAdjacencyCSVAndHalt input output 3

The error which hadoop provides:
